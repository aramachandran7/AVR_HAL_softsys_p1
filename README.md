# AVR_HAL_softsys_p1
The objective of this project is to function as a proof of concept for a new style of systems design oriented - firmware structure for our Formula SAE team. 

It involves building out hardware abstraction drivers for specific microcontrollers and their specific features our team uses (1) and higher level interfacable API's we can call within board firmware (2).
